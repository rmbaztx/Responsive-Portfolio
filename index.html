    <p>
        I was born in Connecticut, but my family moved to Dallas when I was seven years old.  I have since lived in Phoenix, Arizona and Austin, Texas.  My wife, Cindy and I have three children and two grandchildren.  I began my career "fixing" things -- first aircraft instruments, then process automation equipment, followed by CAD/CAM systems, computer-controlled machine tools and what became known as information technology.  I worked for Honeywell International for 32 years with roles in field service, management, marketing, and business transformation.  The broad exposure to many industries and manufacturing processes was very enjoyable.  I am the type of guy who would watch a television show called "How It Is Made;" just naturally curious.  Working for a large corporation was great for me at that time in my life, as I was able to learn something new every day and was not only exposed to methodologies like Lean Six Sigma, but was able to become an "expert" at many disciplines.  I am a life-long learner.  My hobbies include golf, playing guitar, and motorcycling.

  <p>The only downside to my career was the extensive travel it required.  I was away from my family a lot.  While I enjoyed seeing so much in so many different places and working with awesome folks from many countries and cultures, I always felt that I should be closer to home.
